# stable-block-vector
Wrapper around std::vector with stable iterators and pointers, not affected by size growth. Stores data in vectors of pre-determined size.

Please note that this class is not *yet* intended to be complete. Instead, I've tried to keep it is as simple as possible and implement only what I needed in my other projects.
